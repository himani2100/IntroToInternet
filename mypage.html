         I am going to use the content section to explain about the photo. The photo is a quote from the
         <i> <b>

         book series by <b> Sarah Maas </b>. The book series revolves around an imprisoned assassin who
         is offered her freedom back if she were to win a competition and that sets off a series of events
         of unescapable entwining fates. She rediscovers her powers and realizes she is the last hope of
         liberation to the people of a fallen kingdom. The book follows the journey of Celaena Sardothien
         from being an infamous assassin to her embracing her right to the throne of the country of
         Terassen and becoming <b> Queen Aelin Ashryver Whitethorn Galathynius </b>. I really like this book series
         because it has an unconventional and strong female lead and depicts depression realistically in a person.
